# CarPark

This application simulates a car parking lot. If the user runs it, he will be able to see, in the GUI, randomly generated cars that enter, stay or leave the parking lot.
At exit, each car will pay an amount of money depending on how much time it has spent in the parking lot. The history of cars entering and exiting, toghether with the total
amount of money collected can also be seen in the GUI.
